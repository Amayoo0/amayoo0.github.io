### Machine's access
LFI, Local File Inclusion (http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement) where we can access interesting files such as ../../../../etc/passwd or ../../../../../proc/net/tcp. In this last local file we can find all open ports of the machine which we couldn't see before. With nmap we saw all ports that the firewall doesn't filter. And in this file we will avoid it.
