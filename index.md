Hi, I am Antonio Mayo. I am currently finishing my master's degree on Telematics and Telecomunication Networks at University of MÃ¡laga.

During my career I have been acquiring experience with a wide variaty of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, Matlab, Scala... and others that I have learnt for myself like GIT, .Net, C#... Take a look of my lastest projects in the [blog](https://amayoo0.github.io/cyber-lab/blog/) tab.

I consider myself a proactive and responsible person, willing to learn and with special interest in new telecomunication networks, machine learning and cybersecurity. 
Moreover, I have ability to work in group and learn either in team or on my own.
