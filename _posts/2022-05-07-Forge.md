### Scanning process
nmap ip:

Let's examine what type of page is with `whatweb` to see more information about it. 
Now we can analize the main page that it is running in http://10.10.11.111 and we will see that it is necesary to add host forge.htb in /etc/hosts.

There can be others subdomain so use `gobuster` to find all of them.

> admin.forge.htb

This subdomain requires to be as a localhots request but you can use the `upload from url` option, which is vulnerable to *SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)* because you can do a request as a localhost. `Request: http://aDmIn.FoRgE.HtB`. _There are a blacklist input that you can pass playing with capital letters_.

Get the respond with `curl -s -X GET "..."`. There is another section:
> `<a href="/announcements">Announcements</a>`

Let's in and get the respond again:
```
<li>An internal ftp server has been setup with credentials as user:heightofsecurity123!</li>
<li>The /upload endpoint now supports ftp, ftps, http and https protocols for uploading from url.</li>
<li>The /upload endpoint has been configured for easy scripting of uploads, and for uploading an image, one can simply pass a url with ?u=&lt;url&gt;.</li>
```
Ftp is open but it seems to be filtered with firewall. So it's possible to get files with the SSRF.
```
http://aDmIn.FoRgE.HtB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@FoRgE.HtB
```

There we go. We can see the private key (id\_rsa) of the user to connect with ssh.

### Privilege scalation
See the privilege of the user `sudo -l` and there is one aplication that you can run as ALL users. Take a look of how it works and then:
1. Get a new ssh conection.
2. Run as sudo this aplication.
3. Establish a new request with nc: `nc localhost {port}`
4. Submit the password
5. Generate a new interrumption (p.e enter a string instead of int)
6. pdb break point will be generate. Import os and execute: os.system('bash')
